<h2>Project summary</h2>
In this project, I made a portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. There is a menu on the top corner of the screen used for navigation. It will always be anchored to the top of the screen and changes color for the current HTML page you are on whenever you hover over one of the options. The home page includes most of the information on the site including an About Me section and a Contact Me section. The About section has a brief description, some of my interests, and my resume linked at the bottom. The Contact section has a way for the user to access my social links and communicate with me through Email, LinkedIn, or GitHub. The Projects page shows off personal projects I have done. Each project has a title, description, technologies utilized, and associated images. As a final touch, I used Javascript to make the HTML pages have a button on the bottom of the page that smoothly scrolls you back to the top.
